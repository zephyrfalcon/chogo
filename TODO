# TODO

- Stuff we need soon, language-wise:
  - symbol literals? (not sure)
  - return statement (OUTPUT in Apple Logo?)
  - IF (functional style)
  - better error handling at the REPL (e.g. a syntax error should not be fatal)
  - introspection (e.g. which words do we know, etc)

- Also:
  - more math stuff
  - trig functions: SIN, COS, etc. 

- Graphics:
  - Draw a turtle
  - More options for lines, e.g. styles (dashed, etc)
  - We might need a command to refresh the Tk window while drawing.
  - PENCOLOR should accept (r g b) lists

- Write a short explanation of the syntax (and how it relates to Scheme
  syntax). (Coming back to this project less than a year after I started it,
  I've already forgotten how most of it works. Maybe Python's syntax does have
  its benefits, after all... ;-) Also, differences between SHOW and SAY and
  everything would be nice as well.

- Logo commands taken from Apple Logo:
  - CLEARSCREEN (CS)
  - HIDETURTLE, SHOWTURTLE
  - HOME
  - SETHEADING degrees
  - SETPOS x y
  - SETX x, SETY y
  - HEADING
  - POS
  - TOWARDS x y
  - XCOR, YCOR
  - CLEAN
  - DOT x y
  - FENCE, WINDOW, WRAP
  - FILL
  - maybe: PENERASE, PENREVERSE
  - SETCOLOR


- Things that won't be the same as Apple Logo:
  - SUM takes a list, not two numbers
  - no operator precedence; in fact, there are no operators
  - no difference between commands and operations
  - Chogo does have strings, not just symbols
