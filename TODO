# TODO

- Stuff we need soon, language-wise:
  - symbol literals? (not sure)
  - return statement (OUTPUT in Apple Logo?)
  - IF (functional style)
  - better error handling at the REPL (e.g. a syntax error should not be fatal)
  - introspection (e.g. which words do we know, etc)
  - figure out at which point the stack overflows... and if we should fix it,
    and how.

- Also:
  - more math stuff
  - trig functions: SIN, COS, etc. 

- Graphics:
  - Draw a turtle
  - More options for lines, e.g. styles (dashed, etc)
  - We might need a command to refresh the Tk window while drawing.
  - PENCOLOR should accept (r g b) lists
  - We really need a canvas object (probably a record or something) to store
    the canvas size in addition to the Tk window. (We need to know the
    original size if we want to reliably calculate cartesian coordinates; they
    should not change if the user resizes the window (and therefore the
    canvas). ... Alternatively, we could prohibit resizing it. :-)

- Write a short explanation of the syntax (and how it relates to Scheme
  syntax). (Coming back to this project less than a year after I started it,
  I've already forgotten how most of it works. Maybe Python's syntax does have
  its benefits, after all... ;-) Also, differences between SHOW and SAY and
  everything would be nice as well.

- Logo commands taken from Apple Logo:
  - CLEARSCREEN (CS)
  - HIDETURTLE, SHOWTURTLE
  - HOME
  - SETHEADING degrees
  - SETPOS x y
  - SETX x, SETY y
  - HEADING
  - POS
  - TOWARDS x y
  - XCOR, YCOR
  - CLEAN
  - DOT x y
  - FENCE, WINDOW, WRAP
  - FILL
  - maybe: PENERASE, PENREVERSE
  - SETCOLOR

- Meta:
  - A Tkinter canvas might not be the best way to draw things... every line
    drawn is its own object, and the more the draw, the greater the "load".
    Which is, unfortunately, noticeable on this iBook G3. Maybe I should delay
    until I have a faster machine again. But then I'll likely develop an iPad
    version instead... :-)

- Things that won't be the same as Apple Logo:
  - SUM takes a list, not two numbers
  - no operator precedence; in fact, there are no operators
  - no difference between commands and operations
  - Chogo does have strings, not just symbols
