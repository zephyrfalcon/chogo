# TODO

- Stuff we need soon:
  - PRINT (user-friendly printing)
  - REPEAT
  - something to define variables (MAKE?)
    (may be a special form; we'd also have a non-special form for these things,
     but that's uglier)
  - symbol literals?
  - return statement (OUTPUT in Apple Logo?)
  - EVAL (esp. on lists that contain variable names)
  - IF (functional style)

- Once that is done:
  - Tk interface
  - bunch of usual Logo commands: FORWARD, RIGHT, etc

- Things that won't be the same as Apple Logo:
  - SUM takes a list, not two numbers
  - no operator precedence; in fact, there are no operators
  - no difference between commands and operations
  - Chogo does have strings, not just symbols
